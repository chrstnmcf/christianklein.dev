How to set up ESLint with Next.js, TypeScript, Prettier and Airbnb configuration the right way? There are already a ton
of posts out there how to set it all up but none met my expectations. So I want to share with you the ESLint
configuration I have set up for this project.

Configuring ESLint isn't hard, right? You just install the dependency with `yarn install eslint`, run
`npx eslint --init`, follow the instructions, select TypeScript and maybe some code styling configuration like the one
from Airbnb - that's it. If you want to avoid conflicts with Prettier then you also install the `eslint-prettier-config`
dependency, add it to your list of plugins and off you go. Happy linting!

  14:9   error  'React' must be in scope when using JSX                         react/react-in-jsx-scope
```

Oh dear! What happened here? The `eslint-plugin-import` plugin can't resolve imports from files with the `.tsx`
extension, `eslint-plugin-react` doesn't know about the `.tsx` extension as well and also expects
`import * as React from 'react'` which we don't need in Next.js (and also in React >= 17). So we obviously need to
adjust the configuration ESLint just created for us. But how? Let's start with the easy adjustments first.

```js
{
  // ...
  extends: ['plugin:react/recommended', 'prettier'],
  rules: {
    // 1: Turn off rules that are no longer necessary in React 17 and in Next.js
    'react/jsx-uses-react': 'off',
    'react/react-in-jsx-scope': 'off',
    // 2: We do not need to use prop types with TypeScript
    'react/prop-types': 'off',
    'react/require-default-props': 'off',
  },
}
```

**First**, let's turn off the rules that are
[no longer necessary in React 17](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html#eslint) and
in Next.js in general. **Second**, since we use TypeScript we don't need to use prop types but we define the actual
types using TypeScript. And then there is the `<Link>` component from Next.js. Since you need to wrap the child of the
`<Link>` component in an additional `<a>` tag, the `jsx-a11y/anchor-is-valid` rule complains because we didn't add the
`href` attribute to the `<a>` tag. Both the maintainers of the
[eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y plugin](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y/blob/master/docs/rules/anchor-is-valid.md#case-i-use-nextjs-and-im-getting-this-error-inside-of-links)
and the [developers of Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/5533#issuecomment-760776479) are aware of this
issue. They propose different solutions, the easiest would be to globally turn `jsx-a11y/anchor-is-valid` off in your
eslint config. But I decided to go for a custom link component which looks like this:

```js
/* eslint-disable jsx-a11y/anchor-has-content */
/* eslint-disable jsx-a11y/anchor-is-valid */
/* eslint-disable react/jsx-props-no-spreading */
const CustomLink = (props: React.PropsWithChildren<Props>) => {
  const { href } = props;
  const internal = href && (href.startsWith('/') || href.startsWith('#'));

  if (internal) {
    return (
      <Link href={href}>
        <a {...props} />
      </Link>
    );
  }

  return <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" {...props} />;
};
```

This way I only need to disable the rules from jsx-a11y in this specifc component file.

Now that's settled we can concentrate on the remaining TypeScript related issues. Since the Airbnb configuration is made
for using JavaScript but has no TypeScript support, I decided to go for the
[eslint-config-airbnb-typescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb-typescript) configuration which
adds exactly that. So instead of extending the basic Airbnb eslint configuration in your `.eslintrc.js`, you
`"extends": "airbnb-typescript"`. This configuration however needs knowledge of your TypeScript configuration so you
have to specify your `tsconfig.json` in the eslint configuration:

```js
module.exports = {
  extends: ['airbnb-typescript'],
  // ...
  parserOptions: {
    project: './tsconfig.json',
  },
};
```

Ok perfect, now all TypeScript files (`.ts` and `.tsx`) should be fine! But if you lint any regular JavaScript files you
see the following parsing error:

```
Parsing error: "parserOptions.project" has been set for @typescript-eslint/parser.
  The file does not match your project config: next.config.js.
  The file must be included in at least one of the projects provided.
```

Obviously it only makes sense to specify `.ts` and `.tsx` files in your `tsconfig.json`. This is why I decided to make
use of the glob patterns and put the TypeScript specific configuration into the overrides key. This allows us to
configure ESLint to apply these rules only to files matching the given glob pattern (in this case `**/*.ts?(x)`). In the
overrides configuration you can make use of any configurations that are valid in the regular configuration; but you need
to keep in mind that the `extends` setting ignores the root property, so if you added a configuration there (e.g.
`extends: ['prettier']`) you need to specify it again in the `overrides` configuration. So in the end our `.eslintrc.js`
would look something like this:

```js
module.exports = {
  root: true,
  env: {
    browser: true,
    es2021: true,
    node: true
  },
  extends: ['eslint:recommended', 'prettier'],
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaFeatures: {
      jsx: true,
    },
    ecmaVersion: 12,
    sourceType: 'module',
  },
  rules: {},
  overrides: [
    {
      files: ['**/*.ts?(x)'],
      parser: '@typescript-eslint/parser',
      parserOptions: {
        ecmaFeatures: {
          jsx: true,
        },
        ecmaVersion: 12,
        sourceType: 'module',
        project: './tsconfig.json',
      },
      extends: ['plugin:react/recommended', 'airbnb-typescript', 'prettier'],
      plugins: ['react', '@typescript-eslint'],
      rules: {
        'react/jsx-uses-react': 'off',
        'react/react-in-jsx-scope': 'off',
        'react/prop-types': 'off',
        'react/require-default-props': 'off',
    },
  ],
};
```

That is the whole configuration. You can be sure that ESlint will apply the TypeScript (and also React) specific rules
only on files with the `.ts` or `.tsx` extension. For your regular JavaScript files (mostly for configuration, e.g.
`next.config.js` or `tailwind.config.js`) only the basic recommended ESLint rules are applied! The whole `.eslintrc.js`
can also be found [here](https://github.com/chrstnkl/next-twin-starter/blob/main/.eslintrc.js).
